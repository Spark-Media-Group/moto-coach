# üéØ SOLUTION SUMMARY

## The Problem
Order creation failed with: **"Variant with ID: 5008952970 does not exist"**

## The Root Cause
‚ùå **Wrong API Endpoint!**
- Code was using: `/v2/orders` (V2 API)
- Should be using: `/orders` (V1 API)

## The Fix
Changed one line in `api/_utils/printful.js`:

```javascript
// Line 2 - BEFORE:
export const PRINTFUL_ORDERS_ENDPOINT = `${PRINTFUL_API_BASE}/v2/orders`;

// Line 2 - AFTER:
export const PRINTFUL_ORDERS_ENDPOINT = `${PRINTFUL_API_BASE}/orders`;
```

## Why This Fixed It
- **V1 API** (`/orders`) accepts `sync_variant_id` (like 5008952970) ‚úÖ
- **V2 API** (`/v2/orders`) expects `catalog_variant_id` (like 23133) ‚ùå

We were sending sync variant IDs to V2, which didn't recognize them!

## Test Result
‚úÖ **SUCCESS!** Order #131247299 created with:
- Endpoint: `https://api.printful.com/orders`
- Circle ornament (sync_variant_id: 5008952970)
- Total: $14.20

## Try It Now
1. Refresh your checkout page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Add Circle ornament to cart
3. Complete checkout
4. Should work! üéâ

## Additional Changes Made
Also fixed:
- Variable name bugs in `api/_utils/printful-order.js` (lines 759-772)
- Changed field name from `catalog_variant_id` to `sync_variant_id` in checkout.js (line 1456)
- Added both variant IDs to order items for config lookups

See `VARIANT_ID_FIX.md` for complete technical details.
