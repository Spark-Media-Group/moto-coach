# Moto Coach Contact Form Setup### 4. Domain Verification (Important!)
For production use, you need to verify a domain with Resend:
1. In your Resend dashboard, go to Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., motocoach.com.au)
3. Follow the DNS verification steps
4. Update the `FROM_EMAIL` environment variable to use your verified domain

### 5. Deploy to Vercel
## Overview
Your contact form is now set up to work with Vercel and Resend for email functionality.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Set up your Resend API Key
1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account if you haven't already
2. Navigate to API Keys in your dashboard
3. Create a new API key (it will start with `re_`)
4. Copy this API key

### 2. Set up Google reCAPTCHA (Security Protection)
1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
2. Create a new site with these settings:
   - **reCAPTCHA type**: reCAPTCHA v2 â†’ "I'm not a robot" Checkbox
   - **Domains**: Add `motocoach.com.au` and `localhost` (for testing)
3. Copy the **Site Key** and **Secret Key**

### 3. Configure Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your Moto Coach project
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add these environment variables:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key (the one starting with `re_`)
   - `FROM_EMAIL`: `Moto Coach Website <noreply@yourdomain.com>` (replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain)
   - `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`: Your reCAPTCHA Secret Key from step 2

**Note**: The reCAPTCHA Site Key is already configured in the HTML files (contact.html and track_reserve forms).

### 3. Domain Verification (Important!)
For production use, you need to verify a domain with Resend:
1. In your Resend dashboard, go to Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., motocoach.com.au)
3. Follow the DNS verification steps
4. Update the `FROM_EMAIL` environment variable to use your verified domain
